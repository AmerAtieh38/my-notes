## Amer Atieh
* Web developer trainee.
* Electrical Engineer (power).
* Love Physics.
### What I learned from good-developer-mindset:
1. Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software.
2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
3. Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.
4. A mistake caused by a wrong mindset-not necessarily by a lack of programming skills.
5. In the future, the developer realizes that the current requirements are completely different than what they thought.
